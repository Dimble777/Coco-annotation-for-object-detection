# Coco-annotation-for-object-detection
This project is a manual image annotation tool built using Python and OpenCV for creating datasets for object detection. It allows users to draw, edit, move, and delete bounding boxes around objects in images and assign class labels interactively. All annotations are saved in COCO dataset format.
